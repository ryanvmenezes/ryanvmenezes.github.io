      <description>Hello. I&#39;m Ryan Menezes. Here are some things you ought to know about me:
I&#39;m a journalist at the Los Angeles Times, where I analyze data for stories that span a wide variety of subjects. As a member of the Data and Graphics team, I also write stories, craft visualizations and tackle random journalistic problems with the help of code. I&#39;ve been at The Times since 2013, when I started as a fellow in the Minority Editorial Training Program (commonly referred to as METPro).</description>

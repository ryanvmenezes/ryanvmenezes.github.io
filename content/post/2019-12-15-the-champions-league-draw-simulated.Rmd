As someone who grew up watching a truly absurd amount

It would be like if Major League Baseball instituted a playoff series where each team hosts one game and the winner is decided by the total number of runs scored. 

But it occurred to me that the possible matchups in the UEFA Champions League draw are not all equally likely. The draw has two rules: Teams who were in the same group one round earlier can't be drawn against each other, and neither can teams from the same country.

Create the data.

```{r}
teams = tibble(
  team = c(

    'Bayern|b|w|ger',
    'City|c|w|eng',
    'Juve|d|w|ita',
    'Liverpool|e|w|eng',
    'Barca|f|w|esp',
    'Leipzig|g|w|ger',
    'Valencia|h|w|esp',
    'Real|a|r|esp',
    'Spurs|b|r|eng',

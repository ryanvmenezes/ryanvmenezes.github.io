<h3 id="lawlers-law">Lawler's Law: &ldquo;First to 100 wins. It's the law.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Formers Clippers television broadcaster Ralph Lawler's oft-repeated phrase had been the subject of my personal fascination for a long time. I analyzed NBA data to write about The Law's origins, its accuracy, what it says about the way basketball is played and how the man who coined the phrase never changed during his long career. It ran as the Column One, a spot for special feature stories, on Apr. 16, 2019.</p>

<h3 id="drop">How L.A. cops and firefighters gamed the city's unusal pension program for lucrative time off</h3>
<p>A comprehensive look at the city's Deferred Retirement Option Program, or DROP. By joining a city database containing the daily time cards of LAPD and LAFD employees to the list of DROP enrollees, we found abuse to be rampant. In numerous cases, DROP participants entered the program then immediately took long injury leaves, usually for conditions that afflict aging bodies and not injuries suffered in the line of duty. Our reporting also examined how first-responders reacted to changes in the state's worker's compensation system designed to curb the amount of injury claims. We also uncovered a deal worked out by the LAPD chief that allowed him to collect a massive early retirement payment and return to lead the department. City officials reformed the parameters to how much absent employees can collect while in the DROP, in response to our reporting.</p>

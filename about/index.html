<p>Hello! I&rsquo;m Ryan Menezes. Here are some things you ought to know about me:</p>
<p>From 2013 to 2021 I was a <a href="/portfolio">journalist</a> at the Los Angeles Times, where I analyzed data for stories across different subjects. As a member of the Data and Graphics team, I also wrote stories, crafted visualizations and tackled random journalistic problems with the help of code.</p>
<p>My job at The Times combined two of my passions: storytelling and data analysis. I came to love both while I was an undergraduate student at UCLA. For four years I wrote and edited for the student newspaper, the Daily Bruin, spending most of my time in the sports department. In 2013, after brief forays into engineering and math, I earned my B.S. in statistics.</p>
<p>Since leaving The Times I&rsquo;ve worked as a freelance tutor, focused on helping middle- and high-school students in Los Angeles understand concepts in their math classes, and part-time at my local Trader Joe&rsquo;s store, stocking shelves and helping customers get the groceries they need.</p>
<p>I also spend a lot of time using data to answer my increasingly random thoughts (many of them about the world of sports). I consider myself a hack computer programmer after years of using R and python to write scripts that extract meaning from data. But I&rsquo;m interested in learning more statistical theory, particularly methods used in the social sciences to illuminate disparities in the world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a native of India, though I have spent most of my life in Southern California. Currently I reside in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles. My other interests include playing basketball, watching soccer, reading nonfiction, cooking Indian food in my Instant Pot, filling out crosswords and more.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in chatting about any of the above, please get in touch.</p>

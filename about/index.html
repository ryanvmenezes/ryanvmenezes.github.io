<p>Hello. I'm Ryan Menezes. Here are some things you ought to know about me:</p>
<p>I'm a journalist at the Los Angeles Times, where I analyze data for stories that span a wide variety of subjects. As a member of the Data and Graphics team, I also write stories, craft visualizations and tackle random journalistic problems with the help of code. I've been at The Times since 2013, when I started as a fellow in the Minority Editorial Training Program (commonly referred to as METPro).</p>
<p>My job at The Times combines two of my passions: storytelling and data analysis. I came to love both while I was an undergraduate student at UCLA. For four years I wrote and edited for the student newspaper, the Daily Bruin, spending most of my time in the sports department. In 2013, after brief forays into engineering and math, I earned my B.S. in statistics.</p>
<p>I spend a lot of time using data to answer my increasingly random thoughts (many of them about the world of sports). I consider myself a hack computer programmer after years of using R and python to write scripts that extract meaning from data. But I'm interested in learning more statistical theory, particularly methods used in the social sciences to illustrate disparities in the world.</p>
<p>I'm a native of India, though I have spent most of my life in Southern California. Currently I reside in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles. My other interests include playing basketball, watching soccer, reading nonfiction, making Indian food, filling out crosswords and more.</p>
<p>If you're interested in chatting about any of the above, please get in touch.</p>
